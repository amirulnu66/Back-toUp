    <h2>The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</h2>
    <p>Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a
        dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which
        lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside,
        the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle
        of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver.
        Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming
        through a rift in the clouds.</p>
